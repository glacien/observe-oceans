# Observe Oceans project

## https://observe-oceans.web.app

### This is my test task from Mocoding company

##### I decided to compute heat map image locally on my computer and then just paste it on server, because my server not very powerful

#### You can clone this repo and see all my code logic (sorry for long cloning due to large sst.grid size(you can try to put it manually to back-end/src/assets folder))

#### in back-end folder run:

#### npm i

##### to start server locally:

#### npm run build && npm run start

##### to run very primitive test on mocha and chai:

#### npm run build && npm run test

##### to generate image in back-end root folder (my code logic in computeImage.ts):

#### npm run generate-image

## Task can be found in Task.txt

###### Also i'd like to mention that grid file could be transformed to a lot smaller and than procceded and also to reduce github repo size. Also I could configure my projects better. And refactor some code for better prictice, for example consider dont repeat yourself principle in code. And so much more could be done. But this is what I came up with
